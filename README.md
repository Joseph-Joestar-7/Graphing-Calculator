# Graphing Calculator

This project is a Graphing Calculator implemented using OpenGL and GLFW. It allows users to graph various mathematical functions including trigonometric, linear, quadratic, cubic, power, exponential, logarithmic, and modulus functions.

## Features

- Draws coordinate axes.
- Plots different types of functions based on user input:
  - Trigonometric
  - Linear
  - Quadratic
  - Cubic
  - Power
  - Exponential
  - Logarithmic
  - Modulus

## Requirements

- OpenGL
- GLFW [https://www.glfw.org/]
- GLEW [https://glew.sourceforge.net/]
